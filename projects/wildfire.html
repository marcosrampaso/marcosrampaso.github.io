    <h1>Wildfire Prediction in Brazil's Central-West Region</h1>

    <p>
      This project explores the relationship between climatic, spatial and
      socioeconomic factors to predict wildfire occurrences in Brazil’s
      Central-West region. The analysis combines geospatial visualization,
      feature engineering and machine learning models.

    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
      The interactive map highlights municipalities with the highest agricultural
      gross value added (GVA), revealing strong spatial concentration of economic
      activity in specific regions, which are relevant for wildfire risk modeling.

    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
      This map displays the top 100 municipalities with the highest Fire Radiative
      Power (FRP) values, indicating areas with significant wildfire activity.
      The spatial distribution of these fires provides insights into regions
      most affected by wildfires.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
      The crossed data map integrates wildfire occurrences with socioeconomic
      indicators, illustrating the correlation between fire activity and
      economic factors. This visualization aids in understanding how
      socioeconomic conditions may influence wildfire risks.
    
      It's possible to observate that many of the municipalities with high wildfire
      occurrences also exhibit significant agricultural economic activity. In particular,
      the Central-West region of Brazil shows a notable overlap between areas of high Fire Radiative
      Power (FRP) and municipalities with substantial agricultural Gross Value Added (GVA).
