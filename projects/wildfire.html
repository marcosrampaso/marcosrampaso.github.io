    <h1>Wildfire Prediction in Brazil's Central-West Region</h1>

    <p>
      This project investigates the relationship between climatic, spatial, and
      socioeconomic factors to predict wildfire occurrences in Brazil’s Central-West
      region. The analysis integrates geospatial visualization, feature engineering,
      and machine learning models.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
      The interactive map highlights municipalities with the highest agricultural
      gross value added (GVA), revealing strong spatial concentration of economic
      activity in specific regions, which are relevant for wildfire risk modeling.
    </p>

    <div class="map-container">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
      This map displays the top 100 municipalities with the highest Fire Radiative
      Power (FRP) values, indicating areas with significant wildfire activity.
      The spatial distribution of these fires provides insights into regions
      most affected by wildfires.
    </p>

    <div class="map-container">
      <iframe src="../assets/maps/crossed_data.html"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
      The crossed data map combines wildfire occurrences (Fire Radiative Power – FRP)
      with agricultural economic activity (Gross Value Added – GVA) to explore
      spatial correlations between fire events and economic factors.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blue pins:</strong> Central-West region</li>
      <li><strong>Pink pins:</strong> South region</li>
      <li><strong>Orange pins:</strong> Northeast region</li>
      <li><strong>Green pins:</strong> North region</li>
      <li><strong>Red pins:</strong> Southeast region</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The visualization reveals that several municipalities with high wildfire
      occurrences also exhibit significant agricultural economic activity. Notably,
      Brazil’s Central-West region shows a strong spatial overlap between high Fire
      Radiative Power (FRP) and elevated agricultural Gross Value Added (GVA),
      reinforcing the hypothesis that intensive agricultural production is closely
      associated with increased wildfire incidence. Based on these findings, the
      Central-West region was selected for further analysis and predictive modeling.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis of the Central-West Region</h2>

    <p>
      Focusing on Brazil’s Central-West region, this stage of the project investigates
      the relationship between wildfire activity and key climatic, spatial, and
      socioeconomic variables. The analysis incorporates meteorological data —
      including daily precipitation and average daily Fire Radiative Power (FRP) —
      to better understand temporal patterns and potential drivers of wildfire
      occurrences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Climatic variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed
      were obtained from meteorological stations and made available through the Kaggle
      dataset
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region"
        target="_blank">
        Hourly Weather Surface Brazil Southeast Region
      </a>.
      These data were aggregated to daily metrics to enable direct comparison with
      wildfire indicators. After calculating daily precipitation averages, these
      values were merged with daily FRP data at the municipality level to create
      a comprehensive dataset for analysis. It can also be observed that wildfire
      occurrences in the Central-West region are strongly associated with municipalities
      identified as the driest, suggesting that prolonged periods of low precipitation play
      a key role in increasing wildfire activity.
